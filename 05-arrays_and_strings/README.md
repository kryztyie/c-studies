# Module: Arrays & Strings in C

## 📝 Description
This module contains **10 exercises focused on `arrays` and `strings` in C**.  
It explores **core data structures and text manipulation techniques**, including:

- Array declaration and traversal  
- Finding values in arrays (maximum, minimum, search)  
- Sorting algorithms (basic bubble sort)  
- Summation and average calculation 
- String handling without using standard library helpers  
- Character analysis in strings

The exercises are designed to **strengthen logical thinking, memory handling, and data manipulation using `arrays` and `strings`**.

## 🧠 Key Exercises

- **Reverse Array Printing** – Reads five numbers and prints them in reverse order.  
- **Maximum and Minimum Finder** – Finds the largest and smallest values in an array.  
- **Sum and Average Calculator** – Sums all array elements and calculates the average.  
- **Array Search** – Checks whether a specific number exists in an array.  
- **Array Sorting (Bubble Sort)** – Sorts an array using a simple bubble sort algorithm.  
- **Vowel and Consonant Counter** – Counts vowels and consonants in a string.  
- **String Reverser** – Reverses a string.  
- **String Comparison** – Compares two strings without using `strcmp`.  
- **String Concatenation** – Concatenates two strings without using `strcat`.  
- **Palindrome Checker** – Checks whether a string is a palindrome.

> Each exercise emphasizes **array indexing**, **manual string manipulation** and **algorithmic thinking**.

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the C file** using GCC:

```bash
gcc exercise_name.c -o exercise_name
```
2. **Run the compiled program**

```bash
./exercise_name
```
Replace exercise_name with the actual filename of the exercise you want to run.

## ℹ️ Notes

- Each exercise is independent and can be compiled and executed separately.

- Strings are manipulated manually to reinforce understanding of character arrays.

- Modify input values to test different scenarios.

- Make sure to save your files with the .c extension.
