# Module: Functions in C

## Description
This module contains **10 exercises focused on using functions in C**.  
It demonstrates **fundamental programming concepts**, including:

- Function definition and usage  
- Parameter passing and return values  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Mathematical calculations  
- String and number manipulation  

The exercises are designed to **reinforce modular programming and clean code practices**.

## Key Exercises

- **Biggest Number Function** – Determines the largest of three numbers.  
- **Even Number Counter** – Counts all even numbers up to a given number.  
- **Factorial Calculator** – Computes the factorial of an integer.  
- **Prime Number Checker** – Verifies whether a number is prime.  
- **Number Reverser** – Reverses an integer while preserving its sign.  
- **Power Calculator** – Calculates exponentiation using the math library.  
- **Basic Calculator** – Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.  
- **Rectangle Area** – Computes the area of a rectangle using a function.  
- **Sum Function** – Calculates the sum of two integers.  
- **Temperature Conversion** – Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.

> Each exercise highlights **function modularity**, **reusability**, and **clear separation of logic**.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the C file** using GCC:

```bash
gcc exercise_name.c -o exercise_name
```
2. **Run the compiled program**

```bash
./exercise_name
```
Replace exercise_name with the actual filename of the exercise you want to run.

## Notes

- Each exercise is designed to be self-contained. You can compile and run them individually.

- Modify the input values in the program to test different scenarios.

- Make sure to save your files with the .c extension.
